# HardCut

This program is meant to take a user input video file and cut it down to the intended size for editing purposes.
This will be done through the usage of the FFMPEG library.
This is done to avoid the large file sizes normally taken into Vegas Pro 13 which cause the program to slow down.
This also saves on Hard Drive space.
